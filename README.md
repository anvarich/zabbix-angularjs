Zabbix Dashboard
========================
**Intro**
------
The project was started with the goal to make a dashboard that will be used as a central place to check the current status of the company's projects.   

In time the project has grown to a full-blown frontend wrapper with not just dashboard, but stuff like server detailed view, groups overview and search function.     

**Technologies used**
------
It was decided to use AngularJS for implementation and Twitter Bootstrap (with free Cosmo theme) for a quick way to make design. Extra tools used - Karma Test Runner, Grunt, lots of Grunt addons (see Gruntfile.js) and JSDoc (needs Java installed and JAVA_HOME var in path).  

**Installation**
------
- Modify variables in `app/js/app.js` file. 
- Run build process by executing `grunt` in terminal/cmd in the root folder. 
- Copy app/ to production server.
- Enjoy.
